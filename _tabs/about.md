### Bio

I graduated from the Australian National University with a [bachelor][ANU] in Advanced Computing, in the area of Systems and Architecture. I am currently a [MPhil][MPhil] student at the University of Cambridge, researching security for operating systems and programming language(PL) runtimes, associated with the [CHERI][CHERI] team. We aim to utilise the CHERI technologies to devise a verified secure protection model that guarantee high-performance spatial, referential, temporal and type safety for software applications.

### Research Interests

In addition to my main research, I have broad interests in the following areas:

- Cloud and Distributed systems, especially the design of robust, low-overhead, high-performant systems in an industrial viable scale.
- Microarchitecture and Operating Systems, the hardware-software interfaces.
- Cryptography, specifically designing security protocols, and applications to cryptocurrency and blockchains.
<!-- - Formal methods, especially the application of type theory and model checking to software verification. -->
  <!-- - Programming languages and compilers, especially the design and implementation of type systems and static analysis. -->

<!-- the application of formal methods to secure software development. -->

### Fun facts

An interesting fact about me is that I have a strong love for human languages, and initially aimed to obtain a second degree in Languages and Linguistics; eg., I systematically studied Japanese and Korean as my third and fourth languages. However, due to the complexity of some computer science problems, I soon devoted more time to CS and graduated with a single degree. However, in my free time, I still enjoy exploring human languages and literature; and my passion for language studies helped me quickly adapt to the research approach to PL problems, eg., formal verification with syntax and semantics.

<!-- I aim to combine my passion for languages and computer science by researching the intersection of programming languages and formal methods, and to develop secure and efficient software systems that can be easily understood and maintained by human developers. -->

I am also interested in human history and cultures. You may find me inside museums, opera houses, dance theatres, or art galleries off work.
